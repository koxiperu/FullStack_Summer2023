    EXERCISE 2 :

    - Step 1 : 
    Edit 'books.php' page. It will use pagination and show 2 books per page.
    For each book, add a button/link 'add to cart'.
    When you click on the button, it should add the book to the cart.
    Do not add the book multiple times in the cart, use a counter !

    - Step 2 :
    Create 'nav.php'.
    It will contain links to go from "books.php" to "cart.php".
    You should be able to see, in the nav, the number of books inside your cart.
    When you add a book to the cart, it should update this number.

    - Step 3 : 
    Create 'cart.php' page.
    Display every book in your cart and display total price.
    If the cart is empty, display a message "Your cart is empty".

    - Step 4 :
    Create 'remove-cart.php'. It will empty all books in your cart.
    Add a button that will empty the cart in 'cart.php'.
    When cart clearing is done, redirect the user to 'cart.php' automatically.
    You don't have to add 'nav.php'.

    - BONUS 1 :
    Add a button to each book displayed in "cart.php".
    This button will remove this book from the cart but no the others.

    - BONUS 2 :
    Make the book quantity editable in "cart.php" using a single form input.

// Cart must be an array
$_SESSION['cart'] = array();

// Example : 
$_SESSION['cart'] = [
    ['title' => 'Harry potter', 'price' => 12, 'qty' => 1],
    ['title' => 'LOTR', 'price' => 15, 'qty' => 3]
