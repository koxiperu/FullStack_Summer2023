We want to develop a dynamic web application of the type 'Spotify'.

Here is all the information and all the needs necessary for the development of the
database.

Structure:

A music is designated by a title, a release date, an artist and a category.
An artist is designated by name, biography, year of birth and gender.
Example of possible music category: Pop / Rock / Rap / Funkâ€¦.
A user is designated by a name, a first name, an email and a password.
A playlist is designated by a title, a creation date, a user (the one who owns
the playlist) and all of the music in this playlist.

Create the DB design !

Create the db on PhpmyAdmin

Add Data to your db. (Couple of songs and artistes). Create playlists.



Display the name of the song within the most playlists, the most popular song.

SELECT music.title
FROM music
INNER JOIN playlist_music ON music.id = playlist_music.music_id
GROUP BY music.title
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;


Display the name of the artist present in most playlists. Complex!

SELECT artists.name
FROM artists
INNER JOIN music ON artists.id = music.artist_id
INNER JOIN playlist_music ON music.id = playlist_music.music_id
GROUP BY artists.name
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT playlist_music.playlist_id) DESC
LIMIT 1;

List all playlists with the artiste at id 1 in your db.

SELECT playlists.title
FROM playlists
INNER JOIN playlist_music ON playlists.id = playlist_music.playlist_id
INNER JOIN music ON playlist_music.music_id = music.id
WHERE music.artist_id = 1;

List artists in popularity (Popularity is defined by how often they appear in playlists).

SELECT artists.name, COUNT(DISTINCT playlist_music.playlist_id) as popularity
FROM artists
INNER JOIN music ON artists.id = music.artist_id
INNER JOIN playlist_music ON music.id = playlist_music.music_id
GROUP BY artists.name
